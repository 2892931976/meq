# MeQ 

MeQ is a distributed, fault-tolerant technology that allows the creation of large-scale instant messaging applications. The server can reliably support hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users on a single server with massive throughput.

MeQ is written in pure go, so you can easily deploy a standalone binary in mainstream os, and yes, it's cloud native.
